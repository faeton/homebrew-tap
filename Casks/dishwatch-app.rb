# Homebrew cask for the notarized macOS app, and the source of truth for
# faeton/homebrew-tap:Casks/dishwatch-app.rb. Do not edit the tap's copy — run
# `make cask` (after the DMG is uploaded), which renders this file with the
# version and DMG sha256 read out of the published release's checksums.txt.
# The version and sha256 below are placeholders that rendering overwrites.
#
# Hand-written rather than goreleaser-generated: goreleaser can only wrap
# artifacts it built, and the DMG comes from app/Makefile with two notarization
# round-trips and an embedded helper. Updating this file is therefore a required
# release step, not something `make publish` does for you.
#
# The token is `dishwatch-app`, NOT `dishwatch`. A tap may legally hold both a
# formula and a cask under one token, but Homebrew resolves the collision by
# preferring the formula and printing a warning — so `brew install
# faeton/tap/dishwatch` would quietly install the CLI and never mention that an
# app exists. Two tokens, two unambiguous commands:
#
#   brew install faeton/tap/dishwatch            → the CLI (macOS + Linux)
#   brew install --cask faeton/tap/dishwatch-app → the app  (macOS only)
#
# Why the CLI stays a formula: casks quarantine everything they download, and
# the CLI binaries are unsigned, so a cask would hand Gatekeeper exactly what it
# blocks. (Casks themselves are no longer macOS-only — only the `app` artifact
# is — so that is not the reason.)
