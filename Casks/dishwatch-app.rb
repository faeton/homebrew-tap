# The notarized DishWatch menu-bar app. Source of truth for this file is
# packaging/dishwatch-app.rb in faeton/dishwatch; update both together. The
# sha256 comes from the release's checksums.txt, which includes the DMG.
#
# Hand-written rather than goreleaser-generated: goreleaser can only wrap
# artifacts it built, and the DMG comes from app/Makefile with two notarization
# round-trips and an embedded helper. Updating this file is therefore a required
# release step, not something `make publish` does for you.
#
# The token is `dishwatch-app`, NOT `dishwatch`. A tap may legally hold both a
# formula and a cask under one token, but Homebrew resolves the collision by
# preferring the formula and printing a warning — so `brew install
# faeton/tap/dishwatch` would quietly install the CLI and never mention that an
# app exists. Two tokens, two unambiguous commands:
#
#   brew install faeton/tap/dishwatch            → the CLI (macOS + Linux)
#   brew install --cask faeton/tap/dishwatch-app → the app  (macOS only)
#
# Why the CLI stays a formula: casks quarantine everything they download, and
# the CLI binaries are unsigned, so a cask would hand Gatekeeper exactly what it
# blocks. (Casks themselves are no longer macOS-only — only the `app` artifact
# is — so that is not the reason.)
